# ü©∫ Diabetes Prediction using Ensemble Learning

This project presents a machine learning-based solution for early detection of diabetes using an ensemble of classifiers to improve predictive performance. Leveraging the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, it explores various models and combines them to produce a robust and accurate prediction system.

## üîç Project Overview

Early diagnosis of diabetes is crucial for effective treatment and management. This project aims to develop a predictive model using ensemble learning techniques, which aggregate multiple machine learning algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy and reduce variance and bias.

The models used include:
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Voting Classifier** (Hard & Soft Voting)

These models are trained, evaluated, and compared to assess their individual and collective effectiveness.

## üìä Dataset

- **Dataset Source:** [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Features:** 8 medical predictor variables (e.g., BMI, Glucose, Insulin) and 1 target variable (Outcome: diabetic or not)
- **Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, normalized the data, and performed train-test split for validation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Manipulation)
- **Scikit-learn** (Model Building & Evaluation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualization)

## ‚úÖ Key Features

- Implementation of individual classifiers and ensemble techniques.
- Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
- Visualization of model performance to aid comparison and interpretation.
- Reproducible and well-structured code for research or educational purposes.

## üìà Results

The ensemble model (soft voting classifier) outperformed individual models, showcasing how combining predictions can lead to better generalization. The results highlight the effectiveness of ensemble methods in binary classification problems like diabetes prediction.
